## Max Stack

Write a method that returns the “biggest” element in a stack.

## Duck Duck Goose

People are standing in a circle playing Duck Duck Goose. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is removed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and wins the game.

Write a function called DuckDuckGoose() that accepts some strings and an int k. Start at the beginning and count up to k and remove the person at that position. Keep counting from that index and count up to k over and over until only one person is left. Return a string with the name of the last person left.
