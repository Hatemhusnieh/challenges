# Node

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

# Linked List

- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
- The class should contain the following methods
  - insert
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - includes
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: Boolean
      - Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
  - to string
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    - `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`
- Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
- Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

# Linked List Insertion

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
  - arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

# k-th value from the end of a linked list.

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

- kth from end
  - argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
  - Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
  - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# Zip two linked lists.

- Write a function called zip lists
- Arguments: 2 linked lists
- Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below
- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
- Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
